## Description

Pizza Blaster (originally named 'Shooter Shooter') is a shooter game about shooting enemies to protect pizza from around the world.
I wanted to create a basic shooting mechanics similiar to Galatica, shooting enemies that heads towards the player and keeps track
of the player's score throughout the gameplay. Using Galatica as a inspiration, I wanted to aim for similiar art style and SFX/Music.
