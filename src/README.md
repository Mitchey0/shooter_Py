## Description

Pizza Blaster (originally named 'Shooter Shooter') is a shooter game about shooting enemies to protect pizza throughout the galaxy!
I wanted to create a basic shooting game that aims for similiar mechanics to Galatica:
 - Shooting enemies (space) to destroy enemies coming their way and gains 5 points for each destroyed threat.
 - Enemies that spawns randomly from the top of the screen and takes 3 points from player for each one that flies past them.
 - Dsiplays the player's score throughout the game and keeps track of the change of the score, whether its gaining or losing points.

Using Galatica as a inspiration, I wanted to aim for similiar art style and SFX/Music: Note that all audios are copyright free
through the website source, PixelBay.

backgroundMusic - Music to play during the game; loops
blaster_shooter - Adds SFX to the blaster shooting, pairing with the visuals
enemy_DMG - Adds SFX to the enemies to pair with the visuals as the enemy takes damage from player

Moving forward to the visuals, all assets are drawn by me using a website called 'PixilArt.com\draw'. I wanted to add some visuals to add more to the game and lean into the 8-bit and pizza theme:

spacebackground - Gives a space background to the game
pb_logo - Gives visual to the game and add more into visuals during the gameplay
enemies - Asset created to give designs to the enemies
player_(backward, foward, left, right) - Asset created to give designs to the player, giving an illusion of movement.
