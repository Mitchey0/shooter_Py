## Repository
https://github.com/Mitchey0/shooter_Py

## Description
I want my project to focus on the use of pygame and create a playable shooter game. Shooter games are one of the most popular games to play nowadays and learning how to create one will not only help me understand game developement but also continue to learn the python language in ways that wasn't learned in class yet.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Shootable weapon that'll destroy enemies
- Feature 2
	- Timer count down that will run throughout the gameplay
- Feature 3 
	- Upgradable weapons/powers-up that can help aid the player's survival

## Challenges
- Implementing sound and/or music for the game (background music, sfx of shooting, jumps, etc.)
- Load images into pygame 
- Implementing shooting mechanic and destroyable enemies

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A workable game that the player can play and able to reach the end.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- I hope to achieve mouse-point shooters that'll be able to shoot at enemies, with the timer counting down.
